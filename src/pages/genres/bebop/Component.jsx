        Genres that grow too big eventually will fall. This was no different with Swing. Not only became it difficult to maintain such large, expensive orchestras, but more and more white people were copying the music. Though Jazz had always been less racially restricted than Blues, a number of black Jazz musicians felt a need to redefine black Jazz culture with a new, radical genre: Bebop. Their dissatisfaction is reflected in Bebop’s trademarks: frantic, chaotic and aggressive.

        Bebop (or simply “Bop”) is one of the most revolutionary types of Jazz (and music). Why? Because it makes the music faster by making it slower. How? By stretching (thus slowing down) the tempo, a lot of silent gaps opened up between the beats. This free space could be filled in freely (improvised) with drum rolls, rhythmic breaks and superfast, harmonic melodies, usually in vibrato. Musicians also regularly imitate trumpet solos with their voice, leading to a new, fast singing technique called “scatting”. The word “bebop” itself comes from scatting, as it is as an often used onomatopoeia. The difference between Jazz from the past was so huge, that people eventually coined the term “Modern Jazz”, which later also included other experimental genres such as Hard Bop and Free Jazz.

        Many wannabe Bebop musicians went downhill because they wrongly believed that heroin, which was very cheap during the forties, was an inherent part of Jazz culture. Their personal but also social problems (racism) illustrate the dark side of Bebop. This was no happy music, but the psychotic screams of struggling musicians, who didn’t care whether you loved or hated their music.

        Around 1982, Bebop experiences a strong revival known as Neobop (or sometimes called Neo-Con (= conservative) Jazz). A lot of young Jazz scholars were not interested in the new possibilities of Fusion, and chose to concentrate on the old school (with influences from Free and Modal Jazz): straight, acoustic Jazz but rich and vibrant. A type of Jazz where they could show off their technical skills that would otherwise have been masked by the eclecticism of Fusion.
